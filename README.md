# MartirisDev


Hey there, I'm Martiris Yordenis Guzman, and I'm on a mission to become a skilled software developer, specializing in web and mobile development. My goal is to be a full-stack developer, and I'm diving deep into technologies like Node.js, React, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Ionic, and Sass to get there.

I have a genuine passion for learning and problem-solving, and I'm excited about the prospect of contributing to innovative projects. I believe in the power of technology to make a positive impact, and I'm eager to be a part of that journey.
